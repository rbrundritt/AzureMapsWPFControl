## Azure Maps WPF Control Changelog

# 6/14/2024

- Updated to latest version of Azure Maps Render service (2024-04-01) that was announced today.
- Improved the copyright attributions update logic so that the UI only updates if the copyrights have changed. This reduces a lot of flashing of the copyrights when the map has moved. Also ensured that the same copyright never appears more than once.
- Added header to attribute requests so that Azure Maps team can see which accounts are using the solution (will assist them in the future potentially).

# 6/12/2024

- Initial release of solution.
