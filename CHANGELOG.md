## Azure Maps WPF Control Changelog

# 6/14/2024

- Updated to latest version of Azure Maps Render service (2024-04-01) that was announced today.
- Improved the copyright attributions update logic so that the UI only updates if the copyrights have changed. This reduces a lot of flashing of the copyrights when the map has moved. Also ensured that the same copyright never appears more than once.
- Added header to attribute requests so that Azure Maps team can see that this solution is being used, and which render service version is being used. The Azure Maps team can link this back to individual accounts which will allow them to better support users of this solution in the future.

# 6/12/2024

- Initial release of solution.
